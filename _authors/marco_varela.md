  Hey, I'm Marco — a human from Portugal who's just trying to navigate this wild
  ride called life. I might not have all the answers, but I do have two amazing
  kids who keep me on my toes and remind me that being a dad is both a blessing
  and a challenge!


  I'm a bit of a thrill-seeker, and there's nothing quite like feeling the wind in my hair as I hop on my motorcycle or on a bicycle. Those who know me say it brings out my inner daredevil, but I like to think of it as my own version of "living on the edge" without going overboard!


  Now, programming is my little happy place, especially when I'm tinkering with Ruby as I 'am a Rubyist at heart - it's hard to resist the allure of creating digital wonders with just a few lines of beautiful, idiomatic code. But don't get me wrong, I'm no tech wizard; I stumble through it like a kid with a new toy, making mistakes and learning as I go. If I don't have the answer I will admit it but I won't give up until I find it. 


  Here's a little secret—I'm a musical mischief-maker too! When I strum my acoustic guitar, it's not just about playing the classics. Nope, I add my own twist with parody lyrics, and I love the joy it brings! Laughter is the best medicine, they say, and I'm all about keeping the prescription filled. 


  I consider myself a short-term pessimist and a long-term optimist - I'm like a motivational quote wrapped in a sarcastic remark, but it keeps me grounded while still dreaming big. As a self professed nerd, I love to talk about Futurism, Transhumanism and old school Japanese videogames.


  I love to discuss frugality and optimal resource allocation. I've got a knack for finding happiness in the little things, and I love sharing my practical tips with others. After all, a little creativity can go a long way in making life more fulfilling and sustainable without breaking the bank!


  Entrepreneurship is one of my interests - I'm always on the lookout for new ideas and untapped opportunities. Sure, not all my ventures have been homeruns, but hey, it's the thrill of the chase that keeps me going!


  I'm all about spreading love and compassion wherever I can, doing my part to make this world a better place for all living beings -  I consider that my truest gift to the world.


  The world is vast, and there's so much to learn from different cultures and experiences. Plus, building bridges of understanding is not just enlightening; it's downright fun! So join me and never hesitate to drop in a comment ;-)
