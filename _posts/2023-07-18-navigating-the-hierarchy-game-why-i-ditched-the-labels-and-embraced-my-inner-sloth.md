From an early age, I instinctively sought to carve out a unique identity for myself, one that defied any conventional categorization or group affiliation. At the time, I couldn't quite put my finger on the reason behind this drive; all I knew was that I wanted to avoid being confined by labels or confined to a particular role.

As I matured, I came to recognize this tendency as a form of "hierarchy resistance," a defense mechanism against the structures of societal hierarchies. I realized that hierarchies are entirely human-made constructs, arbitrary systems of ranking and organizing individuals based on perceived value or authority. However, their significance is only relevant to those who reside within them.

Consider the hierarchy within a corporate setting: the boss occupies the top, followed by employees at various levels, including the mailroom guy at the bottom. Yet, for someone living a completely different lifestyle, say a [Mundari tribesman in South Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mundari_people), these distinctions hold no weight. To them, individuals in a corporation would all be seen as equals, and they might even assess abilities as inferior, prioritizing skills that are crucial for survival in their environment, such as cattle herding. And the mailroom guy might be a great dancer and be on the top of the hierarchy at the local dance club.

The intriguing aspect of hierarchies is their intimate relationship with [idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism). Those within a hierarchy often perceive their position and the hierarchy itself as desirable and inherently valuable. They ascribe absolute worth to these structures, elevating them above any relative evaluations.

However, we must recognize that the value of a hierarchy is purely subjective. It holds significance only for those who assign meaning to it and remains irrelevant to those who don't. This brings me to an interesting vantage point â€“ being outside of the hierarchy allows me to observe and appreciate the differing reactions to someone's achievements.

For example, consider two individuals: a manager at a prominent company and a skilled artisan from a distant community. To someone within the manager's corporate hierarchy, their position might be commendable and highly esteemed. But to someone outside this hierarchy, like the artisan, both individuals' achievements may not evoke any special admiration. Both the manager's corporate success and the artisan's craftsmanship may be equally valued based on their distinct contributions and context.

This position outside the hierarchy grants me the freedom to assess accomplishments impartially. I can appreciate the unique value that each person brings without being influenced by the hierarchy's internal biases. I recognize that the true worth of an individual lies not in their rank within a hierarchy, but in the diverse perspectives, skills, and experiences they contribute to the world.
