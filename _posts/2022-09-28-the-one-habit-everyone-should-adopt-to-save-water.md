When you first turn the water on for a shower, the water will be either cold or lukewarm. That is because that first water that comes out was left sitting in the pipes and the water heater burners take a little time to ignite. Regardless of the type of water heater you own, that will happen.

Unless you appreciate the benefits of cold showers, you probably won't enjoy stepping into cold water.
So you probably just leave the water running with the shower head pointed at anything other than your body until it gets warm.

Well my friend, you should be saving that water inside a container or a bucket. You can use that water to flush your toilet, water plants or clean the floor.

If you are already doing that then kudos to you! Imagine the amount of water that would be saved if everybody did that.
