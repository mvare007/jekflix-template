***[Shoshin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin)***, which translates to "beginner's mind" or "innocent mind" in English, is a concept in Zen Buddhism that refers to approaching tasks or situations with a fresh perspective, free from preconceptions or biases. In the context of programming, shoshin can be applied to the process of writing software in order to improve the quality of the code and the overall software development experience

When it comes to programming, it's easy to fall into the trap of becoming too comfortable with certain languages, frameworks, and libraries. Especially opinionated frameworks that follow rigid conventions. This can lead to a lack of creativity, an inability to think outside the box, and a reluctance to try new things. By approaching programming with a shoshin mindset, developers can stay curious and open to new ideas, which can lead to more efficient, robust and maintainable code. 

One of the key aspects of shoshin is to approach every task or problem as if it is the first time, without any assumptions or preconceptions. This can be applied to programming by constantly questioning the assumptions behind the code, and challenging the status quo. For example, when faced with a problem that has been solved in the past, instead of copying and pasting the solution, a developer with a shoshin mindset would question whether there is a better way to solve the problem and consider alternative approaches.
