Listen up, folks. I'm here to tell you about the most important purchases you'll ever make in your lives. And no, I'm not talking about a fancy car or designer clothes. I'm talking about the things that separate you from the ground: shoes, beds and mattresses.

Now, I know some of you may be thinking, "Marco, what the hell are you talking about? Those are just basic necessities, not important purchases." Well, let me tell you, these basic necessities are what make or break your day-to-day existence.

First off, let's talk about shoes. You ever heard the saying "you are what you wear"? Well, that applies to your shoes too. If you're walking around in a pair of cheap, ill-fitting kicks, you're basically telling the world "I'm a cheap, ill-fitting person." But, if you're strutting around in a pair of high-quality, properly fitting shoes, you're saying "I'm a boss and I know how to take care of myself." Invest in a good pair of shoes, folks. Your feet (and your self-esteem) will thank you.

Next up, beds and mattresses. I don't care how much you love your partner, your dog, or your Netflix account, if you're sleeping on a piece of crap bed or mattress, you're not getting a good night's sleep. And without a good night's sleep, you're not functioning at your best. And when you're not functioning at your best, you're not living your best life. So invest in a bed and mattress that will give you the support and comfort you need to get a good night's sleep.

Now, some of you may be thinking, "But Marco, those things are expensive." And you're right, they are. But let me tell you, they are the best investments you'll ever make. A good pair of shoes can last for years, and a high-quality bed and mattress can last for a decade. So, in the long run, you're saving money by investing in these things. Plus, you'll be saving yourself from a lifetime of discomfort and misery. 

In conclusion, folks, the things that separate you from the ground are not to be taken lightly. Invest in a good pair of shoes, a comfortable bed and mattress, and thank me later. And remember, if you're not taking care of yourself, nobody else will.
