My childhood was during the 90's and early 00's so I spent the afternoons after school doing typical things kids did back in those days like: 

* Playing football
* Hide & seek
* Stealing fruit from my neighbours trees (which in Portugal we call 'ir à chinchada')
* Playing multiplayer split-screen gran turismo and pro evolution soccer 
* \[Insert 00's clichés]

Back in those days in Portugal, only a fraction of households had a computer and within that tiny fraction only a few had Internet access. 

Knowledge of pre-digital life.

had a gameboy, and ps1 multiplayer split screen
