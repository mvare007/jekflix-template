Ah, the late 90s and early 00s, a magical era that remains etched in the memories of us millennials. As a kid during those glorious days, my afternoons were filled with adventures that seem to belong to a bygone era now. Let me take you on a trip down memory lane and introduce you to the world we knew.

Picture this: playing football under the warm sun, the thrill of chasing and kicking the ball, laughter filling the air. We were masters of hide and seek, sneaking around corners and finding the best hiding spots. And oh, the joy of picking ripe fruits from our neighbour's trees, an act we fondly refer to as "chinchada" here in Portugal.

Of course, our playtime wasn't complete without indulging in some gaming excitement. Multiplayer split-screen battles in Gran Turismo and Pro Evolution Soccer brought out our competitive spirits, as we fought for victory with friends by our side. And who could forget the hours spent immersed in captivating worlds like Pok√©mon, Final Fantasy, MGS, and GTA? Those games were our portals to adventure and wonder.

Music also played a significant role in shaping our experiences. I remember borrowing my older brother's precious collection of music CDs, eager to explore new sounds and immerse myself in melodies that spoke to my soul. Each disc was like a treasure chest, waiting to be unlocked, revealing the hidden emotions of artists who became our guides through life.

Those were the days when computers were still a rare sight in households. In fact, owning a computer with internet access was like possessing a treasure from a distant land. Our world revolved around simpler things, like gathering around a trusty VCR to enjoy our favourite movies or TV shows. And who could forget the legendary Nokia 3310, a robust mobile phone that could easily double as a self-defence weapon if the need arose?

But then, everything changed. The arrival of the Internet marked a turning point in the way we interacted with the world. Sure, telephones and television had their moments, but nothing could compare to the profound impact of this digital revolution. Suddenly, borders and distances seemed to fade away as we connected with people from all corners of the globe.

We witnessed the birth of a new era, where information flowed freely and knowledge became accessible to all. The Internet became our window to the world, exposing us to diverse cultures, ideas, and perspectives. It was a time of both excitement and trepidation, as we navigated this uncharted territory.

As I reflect upon those golden years, I can't help but feel a sense of nostalgia. Our generation was blessed to experience a time when gaming consoles like the PlayStation 1, Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, and GameBoy became cherished companions, transporting us to realms of endless imagination.

We were the last generation to fully embrace a world where physical connections and face-to-face interactions shaped our experiences. Our memories hold the key to a time when technology had not yet woven its intricate web around every aspect of our lives.

So, my fellow millennials, let us celebrate our unique perspective. Let us cherish the memories that will fade with time and preserve the spirit of those incredible years. Though the world may have changed, our hearts still long for those simpler days when the only thing that mattered was the joy of shared laughter and the thrill of living in the moment.

And as we move forward, let us carry the torch of our past, embracing the lessons we learned and the memories we hold dear. For in our stories lies the magic that made us who we are today, the last generation to remember a world untouched by the digital age.

Let us never forget.
