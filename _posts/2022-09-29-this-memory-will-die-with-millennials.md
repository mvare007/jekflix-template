My childhood was during the 90's/early 00's so I spent the afternoons after school doing things kids did back in those days like: 

* Playing football
* Hide & seek
* Stealing fruit from my neighbors trees (which in Portugal we call 'ir Ã  chinchada')
* Playing multiplayer split-screen Gran Turismo and Pro Evolution Soccer 
* Playing Final Fantasies, MGSs, and GTAs
* Listening to my older brothers's music cds

Back in those days in Portugal, only a fraction of households had a computer and within that tiny fraction only a few had Internet access. Cell phones were rare, basic, expensive and clunky. So clunky that they could literally be used as a throwable weapon (see Nokia 3310, known as the brick, what a phone..!). 

Knowledge of pre-digital life.
