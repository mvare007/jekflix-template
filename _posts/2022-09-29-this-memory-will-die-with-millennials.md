My childhood was spent during the late 90's, early 00's so I spent the afternoons after school doing things kids did back in those days like: 

* Playing football;
* Hide & seek;
* Picking up fruits from the neighbor's trees (which in Portugal we call 'chinchada');
* Playing multiplayer split-screen Gran Turismo and Pro Evolution Soccer;
* Playing Pok√©mon, Final Fantasy, MGS, and GTA;
* Listening to my older brothers's music CDs.

Back in those days, only a fraction of households had a computer. Within that fraction, only a few had Internet access. There were probably more households that owned a VCR than a computer.

Cell phones were rare, basic, expensive and clunky. So clunky that they could be used as a throwable weapon ([see Nokia 3310](https://www.androidauthority.com/nokia-3310-900425/)).  

Game consoles like PS1, Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn and GameBoy reached the masses in what was arguably one of the golden ages of gaming.

For all the inventions that had connected humans and reached the masses, back then, we could still say that global society as a whole was not very interconnected and not even a coined term. That is up until the Internet came about. 

First came the advent of telephone in the early 20th century, then came the television in the second half of that century. But no other technology revolutionized human interaction the way the Internet did.
